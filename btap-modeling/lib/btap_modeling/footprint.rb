  # Measured-footprint massing: turn a real building outline (GeoJSON ring from
  # a building-stock source, a survey, a GIS export) plus a measured height into
  # zoned OpenStudio massing.
  #
  # Unlike `wizards.rb` and `bar.rb` this is NOT a port — there is no upstream
  # equivalent. The seven parametric wizards build their polygons analytically
  # from length/width, so winding and validity hold by construction; a measured
  # ring guarantees neither, and every method here exists because raw outlines
  # break something in the SDK:
  #
  # - `Space.fromFloorPrint` needs CLOCKWISE-from-above vertices. Counter-
  #   clockwise returns an uninitialized Optional with no message — the single
  #   most expensive trap in this path, so `normalize` always forces winding.
  # - `OpenStudio.removeSpikes` / `OpenStudio.buffer` are boost-backed and want
  #   the same clockwise rings; a counter-clockwise ring comes back EMPTY.
  # - `OpenStudio.simplify` only drops collinear points — it does NOT decimate
  #   (a 69-vertex outline stays 69 vertices at a 1 m tolerance), so `decimate`
  #   implements Douglas-Peucker to keep surface counts sane.
  #
  # SDK-only and offline, like the rest of the gem: this module takes a ring of
  # coordinates and never knows where they came from. Fetching records from a
  # building-stock service, choosing a storey height, and mapping a building
  # class to space types all belong to the caller.
