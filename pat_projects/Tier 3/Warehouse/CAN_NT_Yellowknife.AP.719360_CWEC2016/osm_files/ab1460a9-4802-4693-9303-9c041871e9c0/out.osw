Seal all windows and doors with weather strip and fill any air gaps with insulation and caulking to prevent air infiltration.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInstall Revolving Doors on the Inner Door Entrance - Replace the high traffic entrance doors with revolving doors.

Notice that loading dock doors and handicapped accessible entrances cannot be replaced with revolving doors.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInstall an Air Curtain for the Loading Dock Door - An air curtain should be installed in the entryway of loading dock doors.  This will greatly reduce outside air from infiltrating during periods of time when loading dock doors are open.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nIdentify and seal other sources of infiltration ?
