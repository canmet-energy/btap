Program Version,EnergyPlus, Version 8.9.0-eba93e8e1b, YMD=2019.08.13 20:52
! This file shows details about the branches, nodes, and other
! elements of the flow connections.
! This file is intended for use in "debugging" potential problems
! that may also be detected by the program, but may be more easily
! identified by "eye".
! This file is also intended to support software which draws a
! schematic diagram of the HVAC system.
