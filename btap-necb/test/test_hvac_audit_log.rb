# The AuditLog implementation moved to the btap-audit gem; this gem keeps
# the historic constant as an ALIAS (lib/openstudio_hvac/audit_log.rb), which is
# the whole compatibility mechanism for every `BtapNECB::AuditLog` call
# site in the gem. The behaviour suite lives in btap-audit/test/test_audit.rb —
# what this file guards is that the alias resolves and still carries the
# `ruling:` axis (D-44).
