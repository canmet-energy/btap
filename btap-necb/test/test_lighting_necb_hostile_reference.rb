# Hostile-outcome gate for the reference LIGHTING transform (NECB 8.4.4.5.(1)).
#
# Method: give the PROPOSED a deliberately non-compliant lighting power, build
# the reference, then assert the reference carries the Part 4 ALLOWANCE rather
# than the hostile proposed value.
#
# Why outcomes and not audit strings: the reference is a CLONE of the proposed,
# so a transform that silently no-ops leaves reference LPD == proposed LPD —
# i.e. the allowance is waived and the proposed is compared against itself. The
# audit meanwhile records a confident "interior lighting applied" decision. Any
# test that asserts on the audit passes while the model is wrong, which is
# exactly how this class of defect survived. Assert model values only.
#
# Expected values are recomputed from the catalog in-test rather than
# hardcoded, so the assertions follow the data if it is revised.

  # proposed's LPD verbatim: the 8.4.4.5.(1) allowance was waived and an
  # over-lit space incurred zero penalty. The allowance for an unlisted space
  # function is a human judgement (4.2.1.6.(1)(b)), so no fallback value is
