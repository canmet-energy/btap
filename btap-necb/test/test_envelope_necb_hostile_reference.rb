# Hostile-outcome gate for the reference ENVELOPE air-leakage transform
# (NECB 8.4.4.3.(6) via 8.4.3.3.(3) + 8.4.2.9.(2)).
#
# Method: give the PROPOSED deliberately non-compliant infiltration, build the
# reference, then assert the reference carries the NECB default and ONLY the
# NECB default.
#
# The subtlety this guards: OpenStudio models infiltration with three unrelated
# object types — SpaceInfiltrationDesignFlowRate, ...EffectiveLeakageArea, and
# ...FlowCoefficient. A transform that clears one and adds its own leaves the
# others in place, so the space ends up with the NECB default PLUS whatever the
# proposed had. Object counts, not just the flow value, are the assertion that
# catches it.
