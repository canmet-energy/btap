# btap-necb docs — which register is which

Two registers are **live**:

- **D — decisions** (`necb_decisions.md`): the judgement calls a reviewer
  cannot re-derive from the code — code interpretations, accepted deviations,
  product-shaping choices. Mirrored machine-readably in
  `../lib/btap_necb/data/decisions.json` and surfaced **at runtime**: code
  paths tag their audit entries with `ruling: 'D-XX'`, and the AHJ report's
  "Decisions and assumptions applied" appendix lists the ones that fired in the
  run. Adding a `## D-XX` heading without a registry entry fails
  `test/test_decisions_registry.rb`.
- **L — legacy findings** (`legacy_findings.md`): defects and divergences found
  in the legacy openstudio-standards lineage, with filing status.

Two registers are **retired**:

- **A (adjudicate) and T (to-fix)** were the working queues of the 2026-07-25
  reference-systems audit (`audit_2026-07-25_reference_systems.md`). Both are
  drained — T1-T13 became D-22, A1-A5 became D-34/D-37/D-38/D-39/D-40, and A6
  became D-45 (ruled 2026-07-29). That file is kept as
  **archived evidence** for the reasoning behind those decisions; nothing new
  goes into it.

The rest of this directory splits into two kinds — know which you are
editing:

**GENERATED — never edit by hand** (each carries a do-not-edit header, and
the CI lint job regenerates both and fails on any diff):
- `NECB_8_4_COVERAGE.html` and `NECB_GEM_COVERAGE.md` — the coverage
  documents, rebuilt by `rake necb:coverage_doc` from the rules manifests,
  the `article:` citation scan, and the cached 8.4 article text.

**AUTHORED reference:**
- `necb_rule_verification.md` — the evidence-tier rules the coverage claims
  must satisfy.
- `archetype_compliance_findings.md` — do the legacy archetypes meet the
  2020 performance path (fixed-point analysis).
- `code_clarity_review.md` — the worked-off clarity review ledger.
- `python_port_m6_m7_review.md` — shareable review of the completed Python M6
  umbrella and the corrected native `py-tbd` plan and acceptance gates for M7.
- `d80_retirement_plan_review.md` — durable review and execution checklist for
  D-80 Rev 4: live Leg C, verification self-sufficiency, and staged Ruby-gem
  retirement.

## Review debt: none

`pending_review.md` — CLOSED 2026-08-02: the deferred review of the
2026-07-29 backlog was executed in full (see the dated entry in
`necb_decisions.md`); the consolidated fleet baseline there is reviewed, not
just swept.

## Family glossary (the house dialect, defined once)

Terms that recur across the five gems' code, docs and decision register:

- **on-ramp** — the `necb_loads:` option: apply NECB space types, loads,
  lighting and (optionally) SHW/HVAC to bare geometry *before* the compliance
  pipeline, so a geometry-only model becomes a valid proposed building.
- **gate** — a pass/fail test. Usually one of the 8.4.1.2 sentence-(3)/(4)
  unmet-hours limits; also used for test-suite checks that block a merge.
- **bump** — one 8.4.1.2.(5) capacity increase: multiplying a thermal block's
  (or the building's) heating/cooling sizing factor by `capacity_step`.
- **secant** — how later bumps are sized: extrapolating the next sizing factor
  from the zone's own (factor, unmet-hours) history, aiming just past the
  100 h limit instead of stepping blindly.
- **iteration modes `zonal` / `global` / `mixed`** — how a bump was attributed:
  per failing thermal block (`zonal`), whole-building fallback (`global`), or
  a facility-level failure with no single failing zone (`mixed`). Recorded in
  `report['capacity_iterations']`.
- **stamp / building-stamp** — the `building:` field every audit entry
  carries (`'input model'` / `'proposed building'` / `'reference building'`;
  absent = cross-building verdict), set by the pipeline at phase boundaries.
- **fixed point** — the cross-validation premise: run a code-minimum
  (reference-grade) building *as the proposed* and expect ~100% of its own
  target. Deviations locate defects in either the legacy archetypes or our
  reference generation.
- **archetype (two senses)** — (1) the NECB 2025 8.4.4 *building archetypes*
  (Table 8.4.4.1 EUI targets; implemented in
  `lib/btap_necb/eui_archetypes.rb`); (2) the project's 17 legacy NECB
  prototype buildings used as the validation fleet (the "fleet"). Reading code
  or docs, check which sense is live.
- **fleet** — the 17 legacy NECB archetype buildings used for sweep
  validation (the "fleet sweep" is the merge gate for energy-affecting
  changes).
- **TTW** — through-the-wall: the Table 8.4.4.7.-A residential row that
  assigns packaged through-the-wall units (vs the identical-copy rule).
- **thermal block** — NECB's normative zoning unit (8.4.1.1); in the facts
  schema and code it is a `zone_group`.
- **vintage** — the NECB edition (`'2020'` / `'2025'`); the API word
  everywhere. (`template` appears only inside vendored legacy 90.1 rows and
  costing CSV columns.)
