#
# Every top-level key in a gem's `*_rules_*.json` is either a RULE (something
# lib/ reads to make a NECB decision) or DOCUMENTATION (units, notes, change
# logs). A rule key that no .rb file reads is dead config: the behaviour is
# either missing, or — more often here — implemented with the value hardcoded
# somewhere else, so the JSON and the code can silently disagree.
#
# Documentation keys must be declared explicitly in the JSON as
# `"non_rule_keys": [...]`. Exemptions are reviewable in a diff rather than
# inferred from a naming convention.
#
# Pure Ruby: no OpenStudio SDK, no gems. Safe to run anywhere.

      Each key above is declared as rule data but never read. Pick one:

        1. WIRE IT UP   — the behaviour exists but reads a hardcoded constant
                          instead of this data. Point the code at the JSON so
                          the two cannot drift. (Most common cause here.)
        2. IMPLEMENT    — the behaviour is genuinely missing. Build it.
        3. DECLARE IT   — the behaviour is deliberately absent. Ensure the
                          article's status is `partial`/`not_implemented` with
                          `gaps`, and delete the dead block.
        4. EXEMPT IT    — the key is documentation, not a rule. Add it to
                          `non_rule_keys` in that JSON.

      A key whose article is ALREADY declared partial/not_implemented is dead
      config, not hidden non-coverage — prefer remedy 3 or 4 there.
