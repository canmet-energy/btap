    #   :all (DEFAULT for add_controls) — every space with exterior
    #     fenestration gets a sensor regardless of any threshold (the legacy
    #     'add_daylighting_controls' blanket option). ReferenceDaylighting.apply
    #     defaults to :necb2020 instead, because the reference building must be
    #     built to the code rule.

    #   :necb2020 — NECB 2020/2025 Article 4.2.2.1., sentences
    #     (10)-(15): photocontrols where the Table 4.2.1.6. column for the space
    #     type requires them AND the general-lighting input POWER inside the
    #     daylighted areas crosses 150 W / 300 W (sidelighting) or 150 W
    #     (toplighting), the two tested INDEPENDENTLY, with the (12)/(15)
    #     exceptions honoured. Areas come from DaylightedAreas (unioned polygons,
    #     4.2.2.3./4.2.2.4./4.2.2.5.), the requirement from
    #     DaylightControlRequirement. See D-57.

    #   :necb2011 — the legacy-exact port of model_add_daylighting_controls'
    #     'NECB_Default' selection, mirroring legacy AS FIXED BY #2119 (merged
    #     2026-07-15, in tree since the origin/nrcan merge), kept reachable so
    #     test_daylighting_parity.rb can still prove the port faithful. It
    #     applies NECB 2011 criteria (areas and effective apertures, ANDed
    #     within the fenestration type a space actually has) and is WRONG for
    #     2020/2025 — that is L-26. What is left between the two is a RULE
    #     difference between the editions, not a defect.

    # Sensor hardware, all paths: ONE DaylightingControl at the centre of the
    # space's lowest floor bounding box, 0.8 m above the floor, illuminance
    # setpoint from the space-type target_illuminance_setpoint, wired as the
    # zone's primary control. Stepped control with 3 steps on the :necb2020 path
    # (4.2.2.1.(11)(a)(i) and (14)(a)(i) want one intermediate level at 50-70% of
    # design power, another at 20-40%, and a point that turns the lighting off;
    # E+ 3-step control gives exactly 67% / 33% / off), 2 steps on the legacy
    # paths (the NECB 2011 minimum, kept for parity).

    # CITATION HYGIENE: the legacy method's docstrings cite 4.2.2.7. through

    # ("Special Applications"), so those articles DO NOT EXIST in either edition;
    # they were NECB 2011 numbers. Where the legacy behaviour is described below
    # the 2011 numbers are named as such, and the live 2020/2025 articles are
    # 4.2.2.1. (controls), 4.2.2.3. (sidelighted areas), 4.2.2.4. (roof monitors)

      #   :any_enclosed_office already meant. Both stay accepted; :legacy is the
